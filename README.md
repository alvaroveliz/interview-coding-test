# ComparaOnline Coding Test

Hi, welcome to my test application to a Software Enginner at ComparaOnline.

This test is based on [ComparaOnline Test Requeriments Specification](https://github.com/comparaonline/interview-coding-test) and it was developed using Node.js.

## Available Commands

-   `npm run test` to run the test suite and display the coverage report
-   `npm run after-30-days` display a product output as the example file in `data/products_after_30_days.txt`

## Recommendations to add new products on the future

1. Create a new product file in `src/products`
2. Create a Class that extends `src/Product.js`
3. Create `updatePrice` or `updateSellIn` as you need
4. Create test file on `tests`
